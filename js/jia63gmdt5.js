video, I'm gonna show you how we helped one of our clients make extra three fifty k every single month using his YouTube channel of only five thousand subscribers. And the story gets even crazier. We helped him generate this extra three fifty k from the unqualified leads that he was getting from his YouTube channel. So we somehow did our magic and managed to convert those unqualified leads into paying customers and turned him into a millionaire, made him the winner of school games, made him meet Alex Somosie, and many more.\n\nSo without further ado and teasing you any further, let's get into the video. So this is exactly what you guys were waiting for. This is exactly the road map that we use to make an extra three fifty k from unqualified leads for one of our clients. We literally turned trash into gold.\n\nSo this is going to be a master class for anyone that either has a service based business. You might have an agency of video editing, might have an agency for paid media buying. You might have an agency for cold emailing. Regardless of what you have, if you have a service based business, then this is for you.\n\nOr if you have a e learning company, that means if you have a course or if you have digital products that you are trying to sell to your audience, or if you have a community or followers on either Instagram, YouTube, any other social media, then this video is a must watch video for you. And last but not the least, if you have a software company, if you operate a SaaS, then this is exactly what you need because then you will understand how organic media will help you generate more buyers and more customers and maybe more than three fifty k every single month using your YouTube channel. So I\n\nwill show you exactly how you can also make three fifty k every single month with just five thousand YouTube subscribers. That sounds so good to be true, right? Let's get into a real case study of one of our clients. So meet our client, Spencer.\n\nSpencer runs a company named EasyA Media. So what does EasyA Media do? EasyA Media helps Shopify brands scale to eight figures. So easy media is an agency that scales e commerce brands.\n\nWhat are their services? They do ad creatives. They do paid ads management. They do landing page optimization.\n\nThey do ad strategy and etcetera, etcetera, etcetera. But where do they get these leads from? Who do they really help? They help e commerce brands and the leads they're getting, they're getting it from their YouTube videos, solely organic and using those YouTube videos, they're getting a bunch of customers every single month for their business.\n\nBut if you carefully look into his channel and see the video titles of the video ideas, it's very high-depth and technical videos, right? So see the title of these videos, to be honest with you, you will see that these videos will go over our head because most of these videos are super, super, super technical videos. So what are these really doing for him, right? As is a very specific videos, they are bringing customers that are already prequalified.\n\nThese customers will have extra trust in them. They will already have high intent. They will actually have their money to buy from him, even though he only has five subscribers.\n\nBut because of him posting such valuable and insightful and technical videos, the followers he has most probably trust him and then know exactly what he's making the videos about. And if you go in-depth and see the cons and pros of making such videos, you will see that with such technical videos, you will not really get a lot of views. You will not be super famous. You will not be asked to take selfies.\n\nYou will need a lot more research to make these videos. You'll have a slower growth curve. The videos will not be entertaining, and they can feel a bit dry without proper video editing. Right?\n\nBut what are the pros? If you make such technical and specific videos, you are surely to attract high intent leads. You will get qualified customers. You will get viewers who are ready to buy.\n\nYou will instantly build authority, and you will instantly build trust faster with your audience. You might also attract me to be opportunities. And these videos, they will be shared among the industry circles. Right?\n\nSo you will already start to have your face known to the big players. And here's the thing. Spencer didn't come to be famous. He didn't come to be an influencer or celebrity.\n\nHe came here to make money. And that's exactly why he made those technical super in-depth videos all along. But the issue was he had a very high ticket offer. And as he had a very high ticket offer, not everyone was able to buy it from him because obviously the requirement for eligibility for his services where they had to make over two hundred ks per month in revenue.\n\nThere's only a few number of businesses that make two hundred ks plus per month in the entire world, let alone among his viewers. But even then, you will see that if he had a diverse ticket price of fifteen ks per month and if he only got ten new customers every single month, I mean, out of five thousand, getting ten is not that hard. Then his total revenue would be one hundred and fifty ks per month. That's from his qualified buyers that he's selling his services to.\n\nThe extra three fifty k I'm talking about, that doesn't come from here. So this one fifty ks is primary source of income through his agency and the leads that he's getting from his YouTube videos. So it's sort of like using one stone. You're getting two birds.\n\nOne is the primary source of income that you are getting high quality leads from your YouTube videos. And these ten customers a month is just zero point two percent of the total followers he has. So what about the rest of the followers? Right.\n\nSo we had to come up with a solution for the rest ninety nine point eight percent of his followers. Because if you see that ten customers out of five thousand subscribers is zero point two percent of his, you know, follower base. So what do we do with the rest ninety nine point eight percent? We need to find a way to make some extra cash from these unqualified leads.\n\nAnd so we did. We figured out how to turn those unqualified leads into a cash printing machine. And then we launched evolve. It was his e learning course where he taught ecommerce brand owners how to scale their brands effectively.\n\nAnd this was priced at nine hundred and ninety nine dollars per month. Now nine hundred and ninety nine dollars per month is a lot for a course, but is it really? See, most of his audiences were already super qualified and high intent to begin with. Like, out of five thousand five hundred followers he has on his YouTube, most of them were already ready to buy for him.\n\nAnd the only thing that was stopping them from working with PENSA was the price because his average ticket price was somewhere around fifteen thousand dollars per month. And not everyone can afford that. But that changed when he offered a do it yourself and a done with you offer using his course. So when he launched his course, people went nuts.\n\nPeople got to be mentored and they got to see the operations of an agency that operates at the highest level, even though they couldn't afford a fifteen thousand dollars service fee for Spencer every single month. What but what they could afford was nine ninety nine dollars every single month to see what was essentially to do for them and just to do it themselves or to have their people do it exactly how expensive would do it for them. Right. So using just nine ninety nine dollars a month, you got to go inside the minds of multiple eight figure, nine figure agency that helps the biggest brands to scale their brand.\n\nRight? So that's exactly the tactic he used with this high intent videos. And you know what? He only needed three hundred and fifty one of the unqualified buyers to purchase his course to make an extra three hundred fifty k.\n\nSo if you look at it from a broader perspective, he is making one hundred fifty k every single month using his agency from the super qualified leads that he is getting. And among the other leads that are not being qualified, the ninety nine point eight percent of the other leads, he only needs to convert three hundred fifty of them. So he turned those unqualified leads into paying customers by having a lower ticket offer of a community or a course of nineteen ninety nine dollars per month. And that's exactly how he made an extra three fifty k every single month.\n\nAnd if you combine the primary source of income of one fifty k from his agency services and extra three hundred fifty k from his course, he's making half a million dollars every single month with, I would assume, ninety percent profit margin. And that's exactly how you can also make that much extra money just by using organic content on YouTube. Then how can you really benefit from this case study? You can follow his exact roadmaps.\n\nYou know what they say? You don't need to reinvent the wheel. You have to just follow what's already being done and what's working for others. If you are a b to b consultant, if you're a coach, an instructor, or if you are an educator of any sort, then this is high time you start making organic YouTube content and convert those audiences and viewers into paying customers by utilizing and leveraging a community on platforms like school or work.\n\nAnd that's it for today's video. I will see you into the next one. Till then. Take care.\n\nBye bye."}],"hls_enabled":true,"embed_options":{"playerColor":"512AA5","playerColorGradient":{"on":false,"colors":[["#2832C4",0],["#8e98ff",1]],"on":"false","colors":[["#2832C4","0"],["#8e98ff","1"]]},"plugin":{},"volumeControl":"true","fullscreenButton":"true","controlsVisibleOnLoad":"true","bpbTime":"false","roundedPlayer":"12","vulcan":true,"unalteredStillImageAsset":{"url":"https://embed-ssl.wistia.com/deliveries/600d415624c94ae765a528510dbb66a6.","width":"3840","height":"2160"},"stillUrl":"https://embed-ssl.wistia.com/deliveries/600d415624c94ae765a528510dbb66a6.","playButton":"true","settingsControl":"false","newRoundedIcons":true,"shouldShowCaptionsSettings":true},"embedOptions":{"playerColor":"512AA5","playerColorGradient":{"on":false,"colors":[["#2832C4",0],["#8e98ff",1]],"on":"false","colors":[["#2832C4","0"],["#8e98ff","1"]]},"plugin":{},"volumeControl":"true","fullscreenButton":"true","controlsVisibleOnLoad":"true","bpbTime":"false","roundedPlayer":"12","vulcan":true,"unalteredStillImageAsset":{"url":"https://embed-ssl.wistia.com/deliveries/600d415624c94ae765a528510dbb66a6.","width":"3840","height":"2160"},"stillUrl":"https://embed-ssl.wistia.com/deliveries/600d415624c94ae765a528510dbb66a6.","playButton":"true","settingsControl":"false","newRoundedIcons":true,"shouldShowCaptionsSettings":true}};
