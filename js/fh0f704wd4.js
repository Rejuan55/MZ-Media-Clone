you first open Photoshop and it looks intimidating with so many options, buttons, menus and panels, it's not your fault. The last time I checked, Photoshop has more than five hundred functions and functions inside of those functions and it's constantly growing at the same time. But you know what, we need to master just three and the rest falls into place effortlessly. Just remember cake tastes perfect.\n\nIn other words, canvas, tools and panels. That's just it. In Photoshop, canvas is where you create your masterpiece. Tools are what you use to create them and panels finally control your entire artwork.\n\nUnderstanding these simple concepts make you the master and you never have to memorize any steps because now you create your own. I'm super excited to share that after a decade of teaching Photoshop and simplifying it for everyone, I've finally created an official master class. This course will guide you through mastering Photoshop from start to finish and even beyond the right way, where we focus on mastering the concepts and not memorizing the steps. It's exactly like learning a musical instrument.\n\nImagine learning a song on the piano. You memorized which key to press after which and congratulations, you can now play that particular song. But what if you now want to play another song? You have to again memorize all the keys one after the other making music a pain and it's Soho restricted.\n\nOn the other hand, if you instead learn the concepts of music theory and learn how to play by ear, you now can play any song or music that you have in your mind. You can compose your own compositions, your own songs, you can get as creative as you want and you gain absolute freedom. Similarly with Photoshop, once you master the concepts instead of just the steps, Photoshop transitions from being this intimidating software to a friend who wants to help you bring your vision and your ideas to life. But just learning the concepts, won't that be boring?\n\nTherefore, we conquer the concepts with real world challenges and work through as many examples as we possibly can. I created PiXimperfect Pro with thousands of feedback that I have received over the years from you through comments, emails, messages, in person conversations, and workshops. I've tailored all of these lessons in a way that answers the most burning questions as you go, so you never have to be confused and if you do, I'm here to help. When it comes to learning any software, we are mostly confused about how to start, where to start or what to do next.\n\nPiXimperfect Pro gives you exactly that for Photoshop no matter wherever you are in your Photoshop learning journey."}],"hls_enabled":true,"embed_options":{"playerColor":"#512aa5","playerColorGradient":{"on":false,"colors":[["#2832C4",0],["#8e98ff",1]],"on":"false","colors":[["#2832C4","0"],["#8e98ff","1"]]},"plugin":{},"volumeControl":"true","fullscreenButton":"true","controlsVisibleOnLoad":"true","bpbTime":"false","roundedPlayer":"12","vulcan":true,"settingsControl":"false","newRoundedIcons":true,"shouldShowCaptionsSettings":true},"embedOptions":{"playerColor":"#512aa5","playerColorGradient":{"on":false,"colors":[["#2832C4",0],["#8e98ff",1]],"on":"false","colors":[["#2832C4","0"],["#8e98ff","1"]]},"plugin":{},"volumeControl":"true","fullscreenButton":"true","controlsVisibleOnLoad":"true","bpbTime":"false","roundedPlayer":"12","vulcan":true,"settingsControl":"false","newRoundedIcons":true,"shouldShowCaptionsSettings":true}};
